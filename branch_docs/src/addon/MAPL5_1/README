Prerequisites:
- NetCDF is required by MAPL, so your ESMF build should include it
- The command "gmake" must be available.  If your distirbution is called "make", add a symlink from gmake to make.  

Build instructions:

1. Set the ESMF environment variables, build and install ESMF.  

2. Set the ESMFMKFILE environment variable to the makefile fragment in the installation from step 1.  More information about this variable can be found here: http://www.earthsystemmodeling.org/esmf_releases/public/last/ESMF_usrdoc/node7.html. 

3. In MAPL5_1/src directory, make install && make esma_doc

4. To run the tests using the ESMF testing infrastructure, first ensure that ESMF_DIR has been set to the source root (you had to do this for step 1 anyway).  Then in the tests directory execute "make" followed by "make run".  The messages will tell you where to find the test output.
