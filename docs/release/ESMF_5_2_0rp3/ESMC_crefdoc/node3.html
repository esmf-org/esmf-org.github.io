2 Applications</A>
</H1>

<P>
<A NAME="part:Applications"></A>
<P>

<P>
The main product delivered by ESMF is the ESMF library that allows application
developers to write programs based on the ESMF API. In addition to the 
programming library, ESMF distributions come with a small set of applications
that are of general interest to the community. These applications utilize
the ESMF library to implement features such as printing general information
about the ESMF installation, or generating regrid weight files. The provided
ESMF applications are intended to be used as standard command line tools.

<P>
The bundled ESMF applications are built and installed during the usual ESMF installation process, which is described in detail in the ESMF User's Guide section "Building and Installing the ESMF". After the installation the applications will be located in the <TT>ESMF_APPSDIR</TT> directory, which can be found as a Makefile variable in the <TT>esmf.mk</TT> file. The <TT>esmf.mk</TT> file can be found in the <TT>ESMF_INSTALL_LIBDIR</TT> directory after a successful installation.  The ESMF User's Guide discusses the <TT>esmf.mk</TT> mechanism to access the bundled applications in more detail in section "Using Bundled ESMF Applications".

<P>
The following sections provide in-depth documentation of the bundled ESMF applications. In addition, each application supports the standard <code> --help </code> command line argument, providing a brief description of how to invoke the program.

<P>
This section describes the offline regridding application provided by ESMF. Regridding, also called remapping or interpolation, is the process of changing the grid that underlies data values while preserving qualities of the original data. Different kinds of transformations are appropriate for different problems. Regridding may be needed when communicating data between Earth system model components such as land and atmosphere, or between different data sets to support operations such as visualization.

<P>
Regridding can be broken into two stages. The first stage is generation of an interpolation weight matrix that describes how points in 
the source grid contribute to points in the destination grid. The second stage is the multiplication of values on the source grid by the
interpolation weight matrix to produce values on the destination grid. This occurs through a parallel sparse matrix multiply.

<P>
There are two options for accessing ESMF regridding functionality: integrated and offline. Integrated regridding is a process whereby interpolation 
weights are generated via subroutine calls during the execution of the user's code. The integrated regridding can also perform the parallel sparse 
matrix multiply. In other words, ESMF integrated regridding allows a user to perform the whole process of interpolation within their code.
For a further description of ESMF integrated regridding please see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:fieldregrid"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A>. In contrast to integrated regridding, 
offline regridding is a process whereby interpolation weights are generated by a separate ESMF application, not within the user code. The ESMF offline 
regridding application also only generates the interpolation matrix, the user is responsible for reading in this matrix and doing the actual interpolation
(multiplication by the sparse matrix) in their code. The rest of this section further describes ESMF offline regridding. 

<P>
For a discussion of installing and accessing ESMF applications such as this one please see the beginning of this part of the refernce manual (Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#part:Applications">II</A>) or for the quickest approach to just building and accessing the applications please refer to the ``Building and using bundled ESMF applications'' Section in the ESMF User's Guide.

<P>
As described above, this tool reads in
two grid files and outputs weights for interpolation
between the two grids. The input and output files are all in NetCDF format. The grid files are either in 
the same format&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:scripgridformat">9.4</A> as is used as an input to SCRIP&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node8.html#ref:SCRIP">3</A>], or in the ESMF unstructured grid format&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:example:UnstructFromFile"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A>. The weight file is the same format&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:weightfileformat">9.5</A> as is 
output by SCRIP. The interpolation weights can be generated with
the bilinear, patch, or first order conservative methods decribed below. Masking is supported for 2D logically rectangular (i.e. with grid_rank=2) grids in the SCRIP format. This application 
can do regrid weight generation from a global or regional source grid to a global or regional destination grid.
It assumes that the source and destination grids are on a sphere and that the coordinates given in 
the files are latitude and longitude values. The coordinates can either be in degrees or radians (this is indicated by the ``units'' attribute attached to the value). 
As is true with many global models, this application currently assumes the latitude and longitude refer to positions on a perfect sphere, as opposed to a more complex 
and accurate representation of the earth's true shape such as would be used in a GIS system. (ESMF's current user base doesn't require this level of detail in representing the earth's shape, but it could be added in the future if necessary.)  This file based regrid weight generation application 
is parallel. This application is used in the 
<A NAME="tex2html9"
  HREF="http://www.earthsystemmodeling.org/users/code_examples/external_demos/external_demos.shtml">ESMF_RegridWeightGenCheck external demo</A>, so that can serve as an example of its use.

<P>
This application requires the NetCDF libary to read the grid files and write
out the weight files in NetCDF format.  
In addition, it also requires the LAPACK library to generate the patch regridding weights.
To compile ESMF with the NetCDF library and the LAPACK library, please refer to 
the ``Third Party Libraries'' Section in the ESMF User's Guide for more information.

<P>
Internally this application uses the ESMF public API to generate the interpolation weights.
If a source or destination grid is logically rectangular, then <TT>ESMF_GridCreate()</TT>&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:example:2DLogRecFromScrip"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A> is used to create an ESMF_Grid object. The cell center 
coordinates of the input grid are put into the center stagger location (<TT>ESMF_STAGGERLOC_CENTER</TT>). 
In addition, the corner coordinates are also put into the corner stagger location 
(<TT>ESMF_STAGGERLOC_CORNER</TT>), for conservative regridding.  The method
<TT>ESMF_MeshCreate()</TT>&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:example:UnstructFromFile"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A> is used to create an ESMF_Mesh object, if the 
source or destination grid is a cubed sphere grid or an unstructured grid. When making this call, 
the flag <TT>convert3D</TT> is set to <TT>TRUE</TT> to convert the 2D coordinates into 3D Cartesian coordinates. Currently, ESMF only supports
triangle or quadrilateral element types for a 2D Mesh.  Therefore, when the cells in an unstructured grid contain more than four edges, they are broken into multiple triangle elements before <TT>ESMF_MeshCreate()</TT> is called to create the ESMF_Mesh object. After the calculation of the weight matrix based on the broken up
cells, the matrix entries for the triangles are merged together, so that the output matrix is in terms of the original cells.  
Internally <TT>ESMF_FieldRegridStore()</TT> is used to generate the weight table and indices table representing the interpolation matrix. 

<P>
The regridding occurs in 3D to avoid
problems with periodicity and with the pole singularity. This application
supports four options for handling the pole region (i.e. the empty area above the top row of the source grid or below
the bottom row of the source grid).  The first option is to leave the pole region empty (``-p none''), in this 
case if a destination point lies above or below the 
top row of the source grid, it will fail to map, yielding an error (unless ``-i'' is specified).  
With the next two options, the pole region is handled by constructing 
an artificial pole in the center of the top and bottom row of grid points and then filling
in the region from this pole to the edges of the source grid with triangles. 
The pole is located at the average of the position of the points surrounding
it, but moved outward to be at the same radius as the rest of the points
in the grid. The difference between these two artificial pole options is what value is used at the pole. 
The default pole option (``-p all'') sets the value at the pole to be the average of the values
of all of the grid points surrounding the pole. For the other option (``-p N''), the user chooses
a number N from 1 to the number of source grid points around the pole. For
each destination point, the value at the pole is then the average of the N source points
surrounding that destination point. For the last pole option (``-p teeth'') no artificial pole is constructed, instead the
pole region is covered by connecting points across the top and bottom row of the source Grid into triangles. As 
this makes the top and bottom of the source sphere flat, for a big enough difference between the size of
the source and destination pole regions, this can still result in unmapped destination points.  
Only pole option ``none'' is currently supported with the conservative interpolation method (i.e. ``-m conserve''). 

<P>
Masking is supported for grids generated from a SCRIP file where the grid_rank=2 (i.e. 2D logically rectangular grids). Masking is currently not supported for 
unstructured grids. If the variable ``grid_imask'' is set to 0 for a grid point, then that point is considered masked out and won't be used in the weights generated by
the application.

<P>
If a destination point can't be mapped because it falls outside the unmasked source grid, then the default behavior of the application is to stop with an error. By specifying ``-i'' or the equivalent ``-ignore_unmapped'' the user can cause the application to ignore unmapped destination points. In this case, the output matrix won't contain entries for the unmapped destination points. 

<P>
This regridding application can be used to generate bilinear, patch, or first-order conservative interpolation weights. The default interpolation method
is bilinear. The algorithm used by this application to generate the bilinear weights is the standard one found in
many textbooks.  Each destination point is mapped to a location in the source Mesh, the position of the destination point relative 
to the source points surrounding it is used to calculate the interpolation weights. 

<P>
This application can also be used to generate patch interpolation weights. Patch
interpolation is the ESMF version of a technique called ``patch recovery'' commonly
used in finite element modeling&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node8.html#PatchInterp1">1</A>]&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node8.html#PatchInterp2">2</A>]. It typically results in better approximations to values and derivatives when compared to bilinear interpolation.  
Patch interpolation works by constructing multiple polynomial patches to represent
the data in a source element. For 2D grids, these polynomials 
are currently 2nd degree 2D polynomials. The interpolated value at the destination point 
is the weighted average of the values of the patches at that point. 

<P>
The patch interpolation process works as follows. 
For each source element containing a destination point
we construct a patch for each corner node that makes up the element (e.g. 4 patches for 
quadrilateral elements, 3 for triangular elements). To construct a polynomial patch for
 a corner node we gather all the elements around that node. 
(Note that this means that the patch interpolation weights depends on the source 
element's nodes, and the nodes of all elements neighboring the source element.)  
We then use a least squares fitting algorithm to choose the set of coefficients 
for the polynomial that produces the best fit for the data in the elements. 
This polynomial will give a value at the destination point that fits the source data 
in the elements surrounding the corner node. We then repeat this process for each 
corner node of the source element generating a new polynomial for each set of elements.  
To calculate the value at the destination point we do a weighted average of the values 
of each of the corner polynomials evaluated at that point. The weight for a corner's 
polynomial is the bilinear weight of the destination point with regard to that corner.  
The patch method has a larger stencil than the bilinear, for this reason the patch weight matrix can be correspondingly larger
than the bilinear matrix (e.g. for a quadrilateral grid the patch matrix is around 4x the size of
the bilinear matrix). This can be an issue when performing a regrid weight generation operation close to the memory
limit on a machine. 

<P>
First-order conservative interpolation&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node8.html#ConservativeOrder1">4</A>] is also available as a regridding method. This method will typically have  
a larger interpolation error than the previous two methods, but will do a much better job of preserving the value of the 
integral of data between the source and destination grid. In this method the value across each source cell
is treated as a constant. The weights for a particular destination cell, are the area of intersection of each 
source cell with the destination cell divided by the area of the destination cell.
Areas in this case are the great circle 
areas of the polygons which make up the cells (the cells around each center are defined by the corner coordinates 
in the grid file). 

<P>
The interpolation weights generated by this application are output to a NetCDF file (specified by the "-w" or "-weight"
keywords). The format of this file is the same as that generated by SCRIP. See Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:weightfileformat">9.5</A> for a description of the format.
Note that the sequence of the weights in the file can 
vary with the number of processors used to run the application. This means that two weight files generated by using different
numbers of processors can contain exactly the same interpolation matrix, but can appear different in a direct line by line
comparison (such as would be done by ncdiff).

                                (and bottom) row of nodes specified in 
                                &lt;source grid&gt;.

                                but projected onto the sphere formed by the 
                                rest of the grid. The value at this pole is 
                                the average of all the pole values. This
                                is the default option.

                                bottom row of the source Grid. This can be 
                                useful because no averaging occurs, however, 
                                because the top and bottom of the sphere are 
                                now flat, for a big enough mismatch between 
                                the size of the destination and source pole 
                                regions, some destination points may still

    --src_type        - an optional argument specifying the source grid file 
                        type.  The value could be either SCRIP or ESMF.

                        the unstructured grid. The default option is SCRIP.

    --dst_type        - an optional argument specifying the destination grid 
                        file type. The value could be either SCRIP or ESMF.  
                        Currently, the ESMF file type is only available for 
                        the unstructured grid. The default option is SCRIP.

    -t                - an optional argument specifying the file types for 
                        both the source and the destination grid files. The 
                        default option is SCRIP.  If both -t and --src_type 
                        or --dst_type are given at the same time and they 
                        disagree with each other, an error message will be 
                        generated.

    -r                - an optional argument specifying that the source and 
                        destination grids are regional grids.  If the argument
                        is not given, the grids are assumed to be global.

    --src_regional    - an optional argument specifying that the source is 
                        a regional grid and the destination is a global grid.  

    --dst_regional    - an optional argument specifying that the destination 
                        is a regional grid and the source is a global grid.  

    --64bit_offset    - an optional argument specifying that the weight file 
                        will be created in the NetCDF 64-bit offset format to 
                        allow variables larger than 2GB.  Note the 64-bit
                        offset format is not supported in the NetCDF version
                        earlier than 3.6.0. An error message will be generated
                        if this flag is specified while the application is
                        linked with a NetCDF library earlier than 3.6.0.

9.3 Examples</A>
</H2>

<P>
The example below shows the command to generate a set of conservative interpolation weights between a global 
SCRIP format source grid file (src.nc) and a global SCRIP format destination grid file (dst.nc). The weights
are written into file w.nc. In this case the
ESMF library and applications have been compiled using an MPI parallel communication library 
(e.g. setting ESMF_COMM to openmpi) to enable it to run in parallel. To demonstrate running in parallel
the mpirun script is used to run the application in parallel on 4 processors. 

<P>
<PRE>
  mpirun -np 4 ./ESMF_RegridWeightGen -s src.nc -d dst.nc -m conserve -w w.nc
</PRE>

<P>
The next example below shows the command to do the same thing as the previous example except for three changes. The first 
change is this time the source grid is regional (``-src_regional''). The second change is that
for this example bilinear interpolation (``-m bilinear'') is being used. Because bilinear is the default, we could also
omit the ``-m bilinear''. The third change is that in this example some of the destination points are expected to
not be found in the source grid, but the user is ok with that and just wants those points to not appear in the weight file instead of causing an error (``-i''). 

<P>
<PRE>
  mpirun -np 4 ./ESMF_RegridWeightGen -i --src_regional -s src.nc -d dst.nc   \
                 -m bilinear -w w.nc

9.4 SCRIP Grid File Format
</H2>

<P>
A SCRIP format grid file is a NetCDF file and the header of a sample grid file is shown as follows:

<P>
<PRE>
netcdf remap_grid_T42 {
dimensions:
      grid_size = 8192 ;
      grid_corners = 4 ;
      grid_rank = 2 ;

variables:
      int grid_dims(grid_rank) ;
      double grid_center_lat(grid_size) ;
         grid_center_lat:units = "radians" ;
      double grid_center_lon(grid_size) ;
         grid_center_lon:units = "radians" ;
      int grid_imask(grid_size) ;
         grid_imask:units = "unitless" ;
      double grid_corner_lat(grid_size, grid_corners) ;
         grid_corner_lat:units = "radians" ;
      double grid_corner_lon(grid_size, grid_corners) ;
         grid_corner_lon:units ="radians" ;

// global attributes:
         :title = "T42 Gaussian Grid" ;
}
</PRE>

<P>
The <TT>grid_size</TT> dimension is the total number of cells in the grid; <TT>grid_rank</TT> refers to the
number of dimensions. <TT>grid_rank</TT> is 2 for a 2D logically rectangular grid and 1 for an 
unstructured grid. The integer array <TT>grid_dims</TT> gives the number of grid cells along each dimension. 
The number of corners (vertices) in each grid cell is given by <TT>grid_corners</TT>.
Note that if your grid has a variable number of corners on grid cells, then
you should set <TT>grid_corners</TT> to be the highest value and use redundant points
on cells with fewer corners. The grid corner coordinates must be
written in an order which traces the outside of a grid cell in a counterclockwise
order. 

<P>
The integer array <TT>grid_imask</TT> is used to mask out grid cells which should
not participate in the regridding. The array should by zero for any points
that do not participate in the regridding and one for all other points.
Coordinate arrays provide the latitudes and longitudes of cell centers
and cell corners. The unit of the coordinates can be either "<TT>radians</TT>" or "<TT>degrees</TT>".

9.5 Regrid Interpolation Weight File Format
</H2>

<P>
The regridding weight output file is in NetCDF format and contain some grid
information from each grid as well as the regridding indices and weights.
Following is the header of a sample output weight file that was generated by 
regridding a logically rectangular 2D grid to a triangle mesh unstructured grid:

<P>
<PRE>
netcdf t42mpas-bilinear {
dimensions:
	n_a = 8192 ;
	n_b = 20480 ;
	n_s = 42456 ;
	nv_a = 4 ;
	nv_b = 3 ;
	num_wgts = 1 ;
	src_grid_rank = 2 ;
	dst_grid_rank = 1 ;
variables:
	int src_grid_dims(src_grid_rank) ;
	int dst_grid_dims(dst_grid_rank) ;

	double xv_b(n_b, nv_b) ;
		xv_b:units = "radians" ;

	int mask_b(n_b) ;
		mask_b:units = "unitless" ;
	double area_a(n_a) ;
		area_a:units = "square radians" ;
	double area_b(n_b) ;
		area_b:units = "square radians" ;
	double frac_a(n_a) ;
		frac_a:units = "unitless" ;
	double frac_b(n_b) ;
		frac_b:units = "unitless" ;
	int col(n_s) ;
	int row(n_s) ;
	double S(n_s) ;

// global attributes:
		:title = "ESMF Offline Regridding Weight Generator" ;

}
</PRE>

<P>
Variables ended with "<TT>_a</TT>" are the variables for the source grid and the ones ended with "<TT>_b</TT>"
are the variables for the destination grid. For instance, <TT>xc_a</TT> and <TT>yc_a</TT> are corresponding
to the <TT>grid_center_lon</TT> and <TT>grid_center_lat</TT> variables in the source grid file.
The grid information includes the center and corner coordinates and the grid mask 
array from the input grid file and
the grid area and grid frac arrays calculated by <TT>ESMF_RegridWeightGen</TT>. 
The grid area array currently is only
computed by the conservative remapping option. The values of the area
array are set to zeros for bilinear
and patch remappings.
For conservative remapping, the grid frac array 
returns the area fraction of the grid cell which participates in the remapping. 
For bilinear and patch remapping, the
destination grid frac array is one where the grid point participates in the remapping
and zero otherwise. For bilinear and patch remapping, the source grid frac array
is always set to zero.

<P>
The <TT>indices</TT> and <TT>weights</TT> generated by <TT>ESMF_FieldRegridStore()</TT> are stored in the output
file as variables <TT>col</TT>, <TT>row</TT> and <TT>S</TT>. Where <TT>col</TT> and <TT>row</TT> are the indices to the
source and the destination grid cells.  These are a one-dimension array with length defined by dimension 
<TT>n_s</TT>. <TT>S</TT> is the weight which is multiplied by the source value indicated by <TT>col</TT> and then
summed with the destination value indicated by <TT>row</TT> to build the final interpolated value of the 
destination.
