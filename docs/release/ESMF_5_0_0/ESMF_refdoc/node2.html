<H1><A NAME="SECTION02010000000000000000">
1 What is the Earth System Modeling Framework?</A>
</H1>

<P>
The Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF) is a suite of software
tools for developing high-performance, multi-component Earth science
modeling applications.  Such applications may include a few or dozens
of components representing atmospheric, oceanic, terrestrial, or
other physical domains, and their constituent processes (dynamical, chemical,
biological, etc.).  Often these components are developed by different
groups independently, and must be ``coupled'' together using software
that transfers and transforms data among the components in order to form
functional simulations.

<P>
ESMF supports the development of these complex applications in a number
of ways.  It introduces a set of simple, consistent component interfaces
that apply to all types of components, including couplers themselves.  These
interfaces expose in an obvious way the inputs and outputs of each component.
It offers a variety of data structures for transferring data between components, 
and libraries for regridding, time advancement, and other common modeling
functions.  Finally, it provides a growing set of tools for using metadata
to describe components and their input and output fields.  This capability
is important because components that are self-describing
can be integrated more easily into automated workflows, model and dataset
distribution and analysis portals, and other emerging ``semantically enabled''
computational environments.

<P>
ESMF is not a single Earth system model into which all components
must fit, and its distribution doesn't contain any scientific code.
Rather it provides a way of structuring components so that they can be used 
in many different user-written applications and contexts with minimal code
modification, and so they can be coupled together in new configurations
with relative ease.  The idea is to create many components across a
broad community, and so to encourage new collaborations and combinations.

<P>
ESMF offers the flexibility needed by this diverse user base.  It is tested
nightly on more than two dozen platform/compiler combinations; can be
run on one processor or thousands; supports shared and distributed memory
programming models and a hybrid model; can run components
sequentially (on all the same processors) or concurrently (on mutually
exclusive processors); and supports single executable or multiple
executable modes.

<P>
ESMF's generality and breadth of function can make it daunting for the
novice user.  To help users navigate the software, we try to apply
consistent names and behavior throughout and to provide many examples.
The large-scale structure of the software is straightforward.
The utilities and data structures for building modeling components 
are called the ESMF <I>infrastructure</I>.  The coupling interfaces and
drivers are called the <I>superstructure</I>.  User code sits between
these two layers, making calls to the infrastructure
libraries underneath and being scheduled and synchronized by the 
superstructure above.  The configuration resembles a sandwich, as
shown in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node2.html#fig:TheESMFwich">1</A>.

<P>
ESMF users may choose to extensively rewrite their codes
to take advantage of the ESMF infrastructure, or they may decide to
simply wrap their components in the ESMF superstructure in order to
utilize framework coupling services.  Either way, we encourage users
to contact our 
<A NAME="tex2html1"
  HREF="mailto:esmf_support@list.woc.noaa.gov">support team</A>
if questions arise about how to best
use the software, or how to structure their application.  ESMF is
more than software;  it's a group of people dedicated to realizing
the vision of a collaborative model development community that spans
insitutional and national bounds.

2 The ESMF Reference Manual for Fortran</A>
</H1>

<P>
ESMF has a complete set of Fortran interfaces and
some C interfaces.  This <I>ESMF Reference Manual</I> is a listing of 
ESMF interfaces for Fortran.<A NAME="tex2html2"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot225"><SUP>1</SUP></A>  

<P>
Interfaces are grouped by class.  A class is comprised of the data and
methods for a specific concept like a physical field.  Superstructure classes 
are listed first in this <I>Manual</I>, followed by infrastructure 
classes.

<P>
The major classes in the ESMF superstructure are Components, which 
usually represent
large pieces of functionality such as atmosphere and ocean models,
and States, which are the data structures
used to transfer data between Components.  There are both data
structures and utilities in the ESMF 
infrastructure. Data structures include multi-dimensional Arrays, Fields
that are comprised of an Array and a Grid, and collections of Arrays
and Fields called ArrayBundles and FieldBundles, respectively.
There are utility libraries for data decomposition and communications,
time management, logging and error handling, and application configuration.

<P>
ESMF class names frequently coincide with words commonly
used within the Earth system domain (field, grid, component, array, 
etc.)  The convention we adopt in this manual is that if a word is 
used in the context of an ESMF class name it is capitalized, and 
if the word is used in a more general context it remains in lower 
case.  We would write, for example, that an ESMF Field class 
represents a physical field.  

<P>
Diagrams are drawn using the Unified Modeling Language (UML).  UML 
is a visual tool that can illustrate the structure of 
classes, define relationships between classes, and describe sequences
of actions.  A reader interested in more detail can refer to a 
text such as <I>The Unified Modeling Language Reference Manual.</I>
 [<A

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION02052000000000000000">
5.2 Method Name and Argument Conventions</A>
</H2>

<P>
Method names begin with <TT>ESMF_</TT>, followed by the class name, 
followed by the name of the operation being performed.  Each new 
word is capitalized.  Although Fortran interfaces are not case-sensitive,
we use case to help parse multi-word names.  

<P>
For method arguments that are multi-word, the first word is lower
case and subsequent words begin with upper case.  ESMF class 
names (including typed flags) are an exception.  When multi-word 
class names appear in argument lists, all letters after the first 
are lower case.  The first letter is lower case if the class is the
first word in the argument and upper case otherwise.  For 
example, in an argument list the DELayout class name may appear 
as <TT>delayout</TT> or <TT>srcDelayout</TT>.

<P>
Most Fortran calls in the ESMF are subroutines, with 
any returned values passed through the interface.  For the sake of 
convenience, some ESMF calls are written as functions.

<P>
A typical ESMF call looks like this:

<P>
<PRE>
call ESMF_&lt;ClassName&gt;&lt;Operation&gt;(classname, firstArgument, 
           secondArgument, ..., rc)
</PRE>

<P>
where <BR>
<TT>&lt;ClassName&gt;</TT> is the class name, <BR>
<TT>&lt;Operation&gt;</TT> is the name of the action to be performed, <BR>
<TT>classname</TT> is a variable of the derived type associated 
with the class, <BR>
the <TT>arg*</TT> arguments are whatever other variables are required 
for the operation, <BR>
and <TT>rc</TT> is a return code. <BR>

<P>


<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION02060000000000000000">
6 The ESMF Application Programming Interface</A>
</H1>

<P>
The ESMF Application Programming Interface (API) is based on the
object-oriented programming concept of a <B>class</B>.  A class is a 
software construct that's used for grouping a set of related variables 
together with the subroutines and functions that operate on them.  We 
use classes in ESMF because they help to organize the code, and often 
make it easier to maintain and understand.  A particular instance
of a class is called an <B>object</B>.  For example, Field is an 
ESMF class.  An actual Field called <TT>temperature</TT> is an object. 
That is about as far as we will go into software engineering
terminology.  

<P>
The Fortran interface is implemented so that the variables associated
with a class are stored in a derived type.  For example, an 
<TT>ESMF_Field</TT> derived type stores the data array, grid 
information, and metadata associated with a physical field.
The derived type for each class is stored in a Fortran module, and 
the operations associated with each class are defined as module
procedures.  We use the Fortran features of generic functions and
optional arguments extensively to simplify our interfaces.

<P>
The modules for ESMF are bundled together and can be accessed with a 
single <TT>USE</TT> statement, <TT>USE ESMF_Mod</TT>.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION02061000000000000000">
6.1 Standard Methods and Interface Rules</A>
</H2>

<P>
ESMF defines a set of standard methods and interface rules that
hold across the entire API.  These are: 

<P>

<UL>
<LI><TT>ESMF_&lt;Class&gt;Create()</TT> and <TT>ESMF_&lt;Class&gt;Destroy()</TT>, for creating and 
destroying classes.  The <TT>ESMF_&lt;Class&gt;Create()</TT> method allocates 
memory for the class structure itself and for internal variables, and
initializes variables where appropriate.  It is always written as a 
Fortran function that returns a derived type instance of the class.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>ESMF_&lt;Class&gt;Set()</TT> and <TT>ESMF_&lt;Class&gt;Get()</TT>, for setting 
and retrieving a particular item or flag.  In general, these methods are
overloaded for all cases where the item can be manipulated as a
name/value pair.  If identifying the item requires more than a 
name, or if the class is of sufficient complexity that overloading
in this way would result in an overwhelming number of options, we 
define specific <TT>ESMF_&lt;Class&gt;Set&lt;Something&gt;()</TT> and 
<TT>ESMF_&lt;Class&gt;Get&lt;Something&gt;()</TT> interfaces.

6.2 Deep and Shallow Classes
</H2>

<P>
The ESMF contains two types of classes.  <B>Deep</B> classes require
<TT>ESMF_&lt;Class&gt;Create()</TT> and <TT>ESMF_&lt;Class&gt;Destroy()</TT> calls.
They take significant time to set up and should not be created
in a time-critical portion of code.  Deep objects persist 
even after the method in which they were created has returned.
Most classes in ESMF, including Fields, FieldBundles, Arrays,
ArrayBundles, Grids, and Clocks, fall into this category.

<P>
<TT>Shallow</TT> classes do not require <TT>ESMF_&lt;Class&gt;Create()</TT>
 and <TT>ESMF_&lt;Class&gt;Destroy()</TT> calls.  They can simply be declared
and their values set using an <TT>ESMF_&lt;Class&gt;Set()</TT> call.  
Examples of shallow classes are Times, TimeIntervals, and 
ArraySpecs.  Shallow classes do not take long to set up and can
be declared and set within
a time-critical code segment.  Shallow objects stop existing when
the method in which they were declared has returned.  

<P>
An exception to this is when a shallow object, such as a Time, 
is stored in a deep object such as a Clock.  The Clock then
carries a copy of the Time in persistent memory.  The Time is
deallocated with the <TT>ESMF_ClockDestroy()</TT> call.

<P>

an implementation perspective.  For an in-depth look at the design

6.4 The ESMF Data Hierarchy</A>
</H2>

<P>
The ESMF API is organized around an hierarchy of classes that 
contain model data.  The operations that are performed
on model data, such as regridding, redistribution, and halo 
updates, are methods of these classes.  

<P>
The main data classes in ESMF, in order of increasing complexity, are:

<UL>
<LI><B>Array</B> An ESMF Array is a distributed, multi-dimensional 
array that can carry information such as its type, kind, rank, and 
associated halo widths.  It contains a reference to a native Fortran array.
</LI>
<LI><B>ArrayBundle</B>  An ArrayBundle is a collection of Arrays, not
necessarily distributed in the same manner.  It is useful for performing
collective data operations and communications. 
</LI>
<LI><B>Field</B>  A Field represents a physical scalar or vector field.
It contains a reference to an Array along with grid information and metadata.
</LI>
<LI><B>FieldBundle</B>  A FieldBundle is a collection of Fields discretized 
on the same grid.  The staggering of data points may be different for 
different Fields within a FieldBundle.  Like the ArrayBundle, it is
useful for performing collective data operations and
communications.
</LI>
<LI><B>State</B>  A State represents the collection of data that a 
Component either requires to run (an Import State) or can make 
available to other Components (an Export State).
States may contain references to Arrays, ArrayBundles, Fields,
FieldBundles, or other States. 
</LI>
<LI><B>Component</B>  A Component is a piece of software 
with a distinct function.  ESMF currently recognizes two types 
of Components.  Components that represent a physical domain 
or process, such 
as an atmospheric model, are called Gridded Components since they are 
usually discretized on an underlying grid.  The Components 
responsible for regridding and transferring data between Gridded 
Components are called Coupler Components.  Each Component
is associated with an Import and an Export State.  Components
can be nested so that simpler Components are contained within more
complex ones.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Underlying these data classes are native language arrays.  ESMF allows 
you to reference an existing Fortran array to an ESMF Array or 
Field so that ESMF data classes can be readily 
introduced into existing code.  You can perform communication operations 
directly on Fortran arrays through the VM class, which serves 
as a unifying wrapper for distributed and shared memory communication 
libraries.

6.5 ESMF Spatial Classes
</H2>

<P>
Like the hierarchy of model data classes, ranging from the 
simple to the complex, ESMF is organized around an hierarchy of 
classes that represent different spaces associated with a computation.
Each of these spaces can be manipulated, in order to give
the user control over how a computation is executed.  For Earth system
models, this hierarchy starts with the address space associated
with the computer and extends to the physical region described by
the application.   The main spatial classes in ESMF, from
those closest to the machine to those closest to the application, are:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The <B>Virtual Machine</B>, or <B>VM</B> The ESMF VM is an 
abstraction of a parallel computing environment that encompasses 
both shared and distributed memory, single and multi-core systems.
Its primary purpose is resource allocation and management. Each Component
runs in its own VM, using the resources it defines. The elements of a VM
are <B>Persistent Execution Threads</B>, or <B>PETs</B>, that are
executing in <B>Virtual Address Spaces</B>, or <B>VASs</B>. A simple
case is one in which every PET is associated with a single MPI process.
In this case every PET is executing in its own private VAS. If Components
are nested, the parent component allocates a subset of its PETs to its
children. The children have some flexibility, subject to the constraints of
the computing environment, to decide how they want to use the
resources associated with the PETs they've received.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>DELayout</B>  A DELayout represents a data decomposition
(we also refer to this as a distribution).  Its
basic elements are <B>Decomposition Elements</B>, or <B>DEs</B>.  
A DELayout associates a set of DEs with the PETs in a VM.  DEs are not
necessarily one-to-one with PETs.  For cache blocking,
or user-managed multi-threading, more DEs than PETs may be defined.
Fewer DEs than PETs may also be defined if an application requires it.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>DistGrid</B>  A DistGrid represents the index space
associated with a grid.  It is a useful abstraction because
often a full specification of grid coordinates is not necessary
to define data communication patterns.  The DistGrid contains
information about the sequence and connectivity of data points,
which is sufficient information for many operations.  Arrays
are defined on DistGrids.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>Array</B> An Array defines how the index space described
in the DistGrid is associated with the VAS of each PET. This association
considers the type, kind and rank of the indexed data. Fields are
defined on Arrays.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>Grid</B>  A Grid is an abstraction of a physical space.  
It associates a coordinate system, a set of coordinates, and 
a topology to a collection of grid cells.  Grids in ESMF are
comprised of DistGrids plus additional coordinate information. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>Field</B>  A Field may contain more dimensions than the 
Grid that it is discretized on.  For example, for convenience 
during integration, a user may want to define a single Field object 
that holds snapshots of data at multiple times.  Fields also 
keep track of the stagger location of a Field data point within its 
associated Grid cell.

6.6 ESMF Maps</A>

<P>
In order to define how the index spaces of the spatial classes relate
to each other, we require either implicit rules (in which case the
relationship between spaces is defined by default), or special Map arrays
that allow the user to specify the desired association.  The form of the 
specification is usually that the position of the array element carries
information about the first object, and the value of the array element carries
information about the second object.  ESMF includes a <TT>distGridToArrayMap</TT>,
a <TT>gridToFieldMap</TT>, a <TT>distGridToGridMap</TT>, and others.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION02071000000000000000">
7.1 Local and Global Views and Associated Conventions</A>
</H2>

<P>
ESMF data objects such as Fields are distributed over
DEs, with each DE getting a portion of the data.  Depending
on the task, a local or global view of the object may be
preferable.  In a local view, data indices start with the first
element on the DE and end with the last element on the same DE.
In a global view, there is an assumed or specified order to
the set of DEs over which the object is distributed.  Data
indices start with the first element on the first DE, and
continue across all the elements in the sequence of DEs.
The last data index represents the number of elements in the
entire object.  The DistGrid provides the mapping between
local and global data indices.

<P>
The convention in ESMF is that entities with a global view
have no prefix.  Entities with a DE-local (and in some cases,
PET-local) view have the prefix ``local.''

<P>
Just as data is distributed over DEs, DEs themselves can be
distributed over PETs.  This is an advanced feature for users
who would like to create multiple local chunks of data, for
algorithmic or performance reasons.
Local DEs are those DEs that are located on the local PET.
Local DE labeling always starts at 0 and goes to localDeCount-1,
where localDeCount is the number of DEs on the local PET.
Global DE numbers also start at 0 and go to deCount-1.
The DELayout class provides the mapping between local
and global DE numbers. 

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION02072000000000000000">
7.2 Allocation Rules</A>
</H2>

<P>
The basic rule of allocation and deallocation for the ESMF is:
whoever allocates it is responsible for deallocating it.

<P>
ESMF methods that allocate their own space for data will
deallocate that space when the object is destroyed. 
Methods which accept a user-allocated buffer, for example
<TT>ESMF_FieldCreate()</TT> with the <TT>ESMF_DATA_REF</TT> flag,
will not deallocate that buffer at the time the object is
destroyed.  The user must deallocate the buffer
when all use of it is complete.

<P>
Classes such as Fields, FieldBundles, and States may have Arrays, 
Fields, Grids and FieldBundles created externally and associated with
them.  These associated items are not destroyed along with the rest  
of the data object since it is possible for the items to be added 
to more than one data object at a time (e.g. the same Grid could 
be part of many Fields).  It is the user's responsibility to delete 
these items when the last use of them is done.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION02073000000000000000">
7.3 Equality and Copying Objects</A>
</H2>

<P>
The equal sign operator in ESMF does not generate any special 
behavior on the part of the framework.  If the user decides to set
one object equal to another, the internal contents will simply be
copied.  That means that if there is a pointer within the object
being copied, the pointer will be replicated and the data pointed to 
will be referenced by the object copy.  As a matter of style and 
safety, users should try to avoid exploiting such implicit behavior.
A preferable approach is to use a class creation or duplication 
method.  Unfortunately, not all classes have duplication methods yet.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION02074000000000000000">
7.4 Attributes</A>

Attributes are (name, value) pairs, where
the name is a character string and the value can be either a single
value or list of <TT>int</TT>/<TT>I*4</TT>, <TT>double</TT>/<TT>R*8</TT>,
logical (<TT>ESMF_Logical</TT>), or <TT>char *</TT>/<TT>character</TT> values.
Attributes can be associated with Fields, FieldBundles, and States. 
Mixed types are not allowed in a single attribute, and all attribute
names must be unique within a single object.    Attributes are set
by name, and can be retrieved either directly by name or by querying
for a count of attributes and retrieving names and values
by index number.

8 Integrating ESMF into Applications</A>
</H1>

<P>
Depending on the requirements of the application, the user may 
want to begin integrating ESMF in either a top-down or bottom-up 
manner.  In the top-down approach, tools at the superstructure 
level are used to help reorganize and structure the interactions
among large-scale components in the application.  It is appropriate
when interoperability is a primary concern; for example, when 
several different versions or implementations of components are going 
to be swapped in, or a particular component is going to be used 
in multiple contexts.  Another reason for deciding on a top-down 
approach is that the application contains legacy code that for 
some reason (e.g., intertwined functions, very large,
highly performance-tuned, resource limitations) there is little 
motivation to fully restructure.  The superstructure can usually be 
incorporated into such applications in a way that is non-intrusive.

<P>
In the bottom-up approach, the user selects desired utilities 
(data communications, calendar management, performance profiling,
logging and error handling, etc.) from the ESMF infrastructure 
and either writes new code using them, introduces them into 
existing code, or replaces the functionality in existing code 
with them.  This makes sense when maximizing code reuse and 
minimizing maintenance costs is a goal.  There may be a specific
need for functionality or the component writer may be starting
from scratch.  The calendar management utility is a popular
place to start.

8.1 Using the ESMF Superstructure</A>

<P>
The following is a typical set of steps involved in adopting
the ESMF superstructure.  The first two tasks, which occur 
before an ESMF call is ever made, have the potential to be 
the most difficult and time-consuming.  They are the work 
of splitting an application into components and ensuring that
each component has well-defined stages of execution.  ESMF
aside, this sort of code structure helps to promote application
clarity and maintainability, and the effort put into it is likely
to be a good investment.

<P>

into ESMF Import and Export State data structures.  This is done

Arrays are simpler to create and use than Fields, but carry less
information and have a more limited range of operations.
These Arrays and Fields are then added to Import and
Export States.  They may be packed into ArrayBundles or
FieldBundles first, for more efficient communications.
Metadata describing the model data can also be added.
At the end of this step, the data to be transferred between
components will be in a compact and largely self-describing

<BR></I>  
Indicates method blocking behavior and PET synchronization for VM communication
methods, as well as for standard Component methods, such as Initialize(), Run()

<P>
For VM communication calls the <TT>ESMF_BLOCKING</TT> and <TT>ESMF_NONBLOCKING</TT>
modes provide behavior that is practically identical to the blocking and
non-blocking communication calls familiar from MPI.

<P>
The details of how the blocking mode setting affects Component methods are
more complex. This is a consequence of the fact that ESMF Components can be
executed in threaded or non-threaded mode. However, in the default,
non-threaded case, where an ESMF application runs as a pure MPI or mpiuni
program, most of the complexity is removed.

<P>
See the <B>VM</B> item in <A HREF="node2.html#sec:spatialclasses">6.5</A> for an
explanation of the PET and VAS concepts used in the following
descriptions.

<P>
Valid values are:
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>ESMF_BLOCKING</STRONG></DT>
<DD><EM>Communication calls:</EM> The called method will block until all
         (PET-)local operations are complete. After the return of a blocking
         communication method it is safe to modify or use all participating
         local data.

<P>
<EM>Component calls:</EM> The called method will block until all PETs of
         the VM have completed the operation.

<P>
For a non-threaded, pure MPI
         component the behavior is identical to calling a barrier before 
         returning from the method. Generally this kind of rigid 
         synchronization is not the desirable mode of operation for an MPI
         application, but may be useful for application debugging.
         In the opposite case, where all PETs of the component are running as
         threads in shared memory, i.e. in a single VAS, strict synchronization
         of all PETs is required to prevent race conditions.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>ESMF_VASBLOCKING</STRONG></DT>
<DD><EM>Communication calls:</EM> Not available for communication calls.

<P>
<EM>Component calls:</EM> The called method will block each PET until
         all operations in the PET-local VAS have completed. 

<P>
This mode is a combination of <TT>ESMF_BLOCKING</TT> and
         <TT>ESMF_NONBLOCKING</TT> modes. It provides a default setting 
         that leads to the typically desirable behavior for pure MPI 
         components as well as those that share address spaces between PETs.

<P>
For a non-threaded, pure MPI component each PET returns
         independent of the other PETs. This is generally the expected 
         behavior in the pure MPI case where calling into a component method is
         practically identical to a subroutine call without extra 
         synchronization between the processes.

<P>
In the case where some PETs of the component are running as
         threads in shared memory <TT>ESMF_VASBLOCKING</TT> becomes identical
         to <TT>ESMF_BLOCKING</TT> within thread groups, to prevent race
         conditions, while there is no synchronization between the thread
         groups.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>ESMF_NONBLOCKING</STRONG></DT>
<DD><EM>Communication calls:</EM> The called method will not block but 
         returns immediately after initiating the requested operation. It is
         unsafe to modify or use participating local data before all local
         operations have completed. Use the <TT>ESMF_VMCommWait()</TT> or
         <TT>ESMF_VMCommQueueWait()</TT> method to block the local PET until
         local data access is safe again. 

<P>
<EM>Component calls:</EM> The behavior of this mode is fundamentally
         different for threaded and non-threaded components,
         independent on whether the components use shared memory or not.
         The <TT>ESMF_NONBLOCKING</TT> mode is the most complex mode for
         calling component methods and should only be used if the extra
         control, described below, is absolutely necessary.

<P>
For non-threaded components (the ESMF default)
         calling a component method with <TT>ESMF_NONBLOCKING</TT>
         is identical to calling it with <TT>ESMF_VASBLOCKING</TT>. However,
         different than for <TT>ESMF_VASBLOCKING</TT>, a call to
         <TT>ESMF_GridCompWait()</TT> or <TT>ESMF_CplCompWait()</TT> is
         required in order to deallocate memory internally allocated for the
         <TT>ESMF_NONBLOCKING</TT> mode.

<P>
For threaded components the calling PETs
         of the parent component will not be blocked and return immediately
         after initiating the requested child component method. In this
         scenario parent and child components will run concurrently in
         identical VASs. This is the most complex mode of operation.
         It is unsafe to modify or use VAS local data that
         may be accessed by concurrently running components until the child
         component method has completed. Use the appropriate
         <TT>ESMF_GridCompWait()</TT> or <TT>ESMF_CplCompWait()</TT> method to
         block the local parent PET until the child component method has
         completed in the local VAS.

9.2.3 ESMF_CommFlag
</H3>
<I>DESCRIPTION:
<BR></I>  
Switch between blocking and non-blocking execution of RouteHandle based
communication calls. Every RouteHandle based communication method contains
an optional argument <TT>commflag</TT> that is of type <TT>ESMF_CommFlag</TT>.

<P>
Valid values are:
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>ESMF_COMM_BLOCKING</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Execute a precomputed communication pattern in blocking mode. This
         mode guarantees that when the method returns all PET-local data
         transfers, both in-bound and out-bound, have finished. 
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>ESMF_COMM_NBSTART</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Start executing a precomputed communication pattern in non-blocking
         mode. When a method returns from being called in this mode, it
         guarantees that all PET-local out-bound data has been transferred.
         It is now safe for the user to overwrite out-bound data elements.
         No guarantees are made for in-bound data elements at this stage. It is
         unsafe to access these elements until a call in
         <TT>ESMF_COMM_NBTESTFINISH</TT> mode has been issued and has returned
         with <TT>finishedflag</TT> equal to .true., or a call in
         <TT>ESMF_COMM_NBWAITFINISH</TT> mode has been issued and has returned.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>ESMF_COMM_NBTESTFINISH</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Test whether the transfer of data of a precomputed communication
         pattern, started with <TT>ESMF_COMM_NBSTART</TT>, has completed.
         Finish up as much as possible and set the <TT>finishedflag</TT> to 
         <TT>.true.</TT> if <EM>all</EM> data operations have completed, or
         <TT>.false.</TT> if there are still outstanding transfers. Only after
         a <TT>finishedflag</TT> equal to <TT>.true.</TT> has been returned is it
         safe to access any of the in-bound data elements.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>ESMF_COMM_NBWAITFINISH</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Wait (i.e. block) until the transfer of data of a precomputed
         communication pattern, started with <TT>ESMF_COMM_NBSTART</TT>, has
         completed. Finish up <EM>all</EM> data operations and set the returned 
         <TT>finishedflag</TT> to <TT>.true.</TT>. It is safe to access any of the

<P>
Valid values are:
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>ESMF_CHILD_IN_NEW_VM</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The component is running in its own, separate VM context. Resources
         are inherited from the parent but can be arranged to fit the

</DD>
<DT><STRONG>ESMF_CHILD_IN_PARENT_VM</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The component uses the parent's VM for resource management. Compared
         to components that use their own VM context components that run in the
         parent's VM context are more light-weight with respect to the overhead
         of calling into their initialize, run and finalize methods.
         Furthermore, VM-specific properties remain unchanged when going from
         the parent component to the child component. These properties include
         the MPI communicator, the number of PETs, the PET labeling, 
         communication attributes, threading-level.

These are integer parameters of the proper type to be
used when declaring variables with a specific precision 
in Fortran syntax.  For example:
<PRE>
 integer(ESMF_KIND_I4) :: myintegervariable
 real(ESMF_KIND_R4) :: myrealvariable
</PRE>
The Fortran 90 standard does not mandate what numeric values
correspond to actual number of bytes allocated for the
various kinds, so these are defined by ESMF to be correct across
the different supported Fortran 90 compilers.   Note that not
all compilers support every kind listed below; in particular
1 and 2 byte integers can be problematic.

described in Section <A HREF="node2.html#sec:deepshallow">6.2</A> differ in how and where they
are allocated within a multi-language implementation environment.  We
distinguish between the implementation language, which is the language
a method is written in, and the calling language, which is the language
that the user application is written in.  Deep classes are allocated 
off the process heap by the implementation language.  Shallow classes
