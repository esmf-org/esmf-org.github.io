### Overview

The Earth System Modeling eXecutable (ESMX) Layer is built on top of the ESMF and NUOPC APIs. The goals of ESMX are to:
- simplify standing up new NUOPC-based systems,
- promote hierarchical model component testing, 
- reduce the cost of maintaining NUOPC-based modeling systems, 
- improve alignment and interoperability between different NUOPC-based systems, and
- provide a fast and coordinated roll-out strategy for new ESMF/NUOPC features.

### Download and Install

The ESMX Layer is included with the [ESMF distribution](/download/).
No separate download or installation is required.

### Documentation

See the [README.md](https://github.com/esmf-org/esmf/tree/develop/src/addon/ESMX) for the current ESMX documentation.

### Tutorial
