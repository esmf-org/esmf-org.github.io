This page includes a brief overview of the organizational bodies* 

## Executive Management

The **Executive Board** is the primary management body of the ESMF.  It sets the goals,
scope, and strategic direction of the Project as a whole, and provides technical and
scientific guidance on practical matters as they arise.  It's membership consists of
leads from ESMF's collaborating organizations: NASA, NOAA, U.S. Navy, NCAR, and the
National Earth System Prediction Capability (ESPC).

The **Interagency Working Group** (IAWG) provides a forum for ESMF stakeholder agencies
to interact on a regular basis regarding the vision, goals, and progress of the
ESMF effort as they relate to each agencyâ€™s mission and plans. IAWG membership
consists of program managers from ESMF's funding partners, currently including
NASA, NOAA, U.S. Navy, and NCAR.

## Working Project

The **Core Team** is the part of the ESMF project responsible for implementing the framework
software and maintaining the collaboration environment. The Core Team consists of software
developers, testers, administrative staff, user support and training staff, web developers,
and the Core Team Manager.

The **Joint Specification Team** (JST) is a group of active users that interact with the Core Team
and the broader community, providing requirements and feedback for the ESMF software interface.

The **Change Review Board** (CRB) prioritizes tasks and prepares a Core Team development schedule,
and plans, authorizes, and reviews the content of ESMF releases. The CRB is populated with
application developers representing agency and institutional stakeholders of the ESMF project.

The **Content Standards Committee** (CSC) is the primary committee responsible for evolving and expanding
interoperability standards for the NUOPC partners.

The **Model Component Liaison** (MCL) Committee is a subcommittee of the CSC charged with advancing the
readiness and reliability of components that have standard NUOPC Layer interfaces.
