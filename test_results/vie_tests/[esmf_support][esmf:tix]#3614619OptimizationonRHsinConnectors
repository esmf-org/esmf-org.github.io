Gerhard, What is your priority for optimization of RHs in the Connector when one side is a grid and one side is a mesh? I think you said it was relatively easy

Following up on this, another option related to Connector RH optimization is the ability to read in a RH from file.  This capability already exists in ESMF and so I suspect adding it to a NUOPC Connector would be straightforward. The idea would be to introduce a standard attribute to the connector that, if set, would be the path to a RH file.  If this attribute is present, the Connector would create the RH based on that file and use it for all field communication. It would be the user's responsibility to know that the RH file is appropriate for the source/dest fields.  

A related optional attribute to the Connector would instruct it to write out a RH generated online.

In CESM we could optionally use this for all of the redist operations from caps to the mediator.

It is something we would benefit from in CESM in the short term since we are running into cases where we have a cap with a grid and a mesh in the Mediator and the init time is very slow.

An alternative, less satisfying, implementation might be to force the connector to assume that the first RH generated is good in all cases.  We would consider such a workaround only if you think that it will take some time to get to the real optimization.
