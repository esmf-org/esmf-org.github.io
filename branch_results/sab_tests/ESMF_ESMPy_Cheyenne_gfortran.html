 The tarballs of the tests and examples directories can be found at:
 /glade/work/svasquez/scripts_dir/daily/esmpy/gfortran/esmf_logs/2004_t=
est.
 These tarballs contain the *Log and *stdout files only, not the execut=
ables.
 This directory also contains failed build output files with the naming=
 convention of=20
 build_ESMF_BOPT_(day)(platform)ESMF_OS ESMF_ABI ESMF_COMPILER ESMF_COM=
M.
 For example, if the build fails on longs on the 19th of the month with=
 ESMF_BOPT=3Dg, the file=20
 would be called 'build_g_19longslinux32pgimpiuni'.
